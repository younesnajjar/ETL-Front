## What is ETL-Front?

ETL-Front is the Front-End of an Extract-Transform-Load(ETL) system that was essecially made for Berexia Hackathon and it's Under Developement.

## What is the Utility of the project?

The main reason of the app is to minupilate large (csv,xsls) files with basic SQL selectors Using a friendly interface.

## Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ (the Back-End should be running and the default path for it is http://localhost:8080/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development server with Service Worker
Run `npm run build--prod` to build in production with service worker pre-cache and then `npm run static-serve` to serve.

## Build with Service Worker

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `npm run build--prod` for a production build.
